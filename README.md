# CSV Parser #

This code is an example from a real world scenario that has been modified to protect the source. The code is one file from a large PHP application.

The context of the file is a parser of a result file from a specific Singapore bank regarding bank transfers. There were multiple banks from multiple countries involved in this application.

To install the dependencies run `composer install` (this assumes you have composer installed in your environment)

The code works and outputs what it required. Included is one test file with one test. This can be run and should pass with `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests`
